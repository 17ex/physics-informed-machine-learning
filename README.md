# Physics-Informed Machine Learning
This repository will host the tutorials created by the participants of the `Physics-Informed Machine Learning` seminar. 

## Short description
In this seminar, we will explore influential papers in the field of physics-informed machine learning. This includes well-established concepts such as Gaussian process-based PDE solvers, Neural ODEs, and Neural Operators, as well as more recent advancements like hybrid models and foundational models for PDE solving. The goal is for you to prepare a self-contained tutorial based on a selected paper, which you will present in a block seminar at the end of the semester. Through these presentations and tutorials, we will discuss how physical knowledge can be encoded into machine learning models and examine the current limitations of these methods.
